        <h1>Chemistry Assignment</h1>
        <p>
            Chemistry is the branch of science that deals with the properties , composition, and behaviour of matter. It is a fascinating field that explores the building blocks of the universe.
        </p>
        <h2>Chemical Elements</h2>
        <p>
            The periodictable is a tabular arrangement of chemical elements. Each element is represented by its chemical symbol, such as Fe for iron, H for hydrogen, and O for oxygen. Elements are classified into groups and periods based on their properties.
        </p>
        <h3>Chemical Equations</h3>
        <p>
            Chemical reactions are represented using chemical equations. Here's an example of a chemical reaction:
        </p>
        <p>
            2H<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>2</sub>  &rarr; 2H<sub>2</sub>O
        </p>
        <p>
            This equation represents the reaction between hydrogen gas <i>(H<sub>2</sub>)</i> and oxygen gas <i>(O<sub>2</sub>)</i> to form water <i>(H<sub>2</sub>O)</i>.
        </p>
        <h4>Important Concepts</h4>
        <p>
            <span style="font-family: 'Courier New'; font-weight:400;">Stoichiometry</span> is the calculation of reactants and products in chemical reactions. It involves balancing chemical equations to ensure mass and charge are conserved.  
        </p>
        <p>
            <sub>Subscripts</sub> indicate the number of atoms of each element in a molecule, while <sup>superscripts</sup> represent charges or the number of atoms in an ion.
        </p>
        <h5>Conclusion</h5>
        <p>
            Chemistry plays a crucial role in understanding the world around us. From the composition of the air we breathe to the reactions that power our bodies, Chemistry influences every aspect of our lives.
